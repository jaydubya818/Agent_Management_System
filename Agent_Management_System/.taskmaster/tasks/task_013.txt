# Task ID: 13
# Title: Champion/Challenger A/B Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: A/B testing framework for comparing agent versions and performance optimization
# Details:
Implement traffic splitting logic for routing requests to different agent versions. Create comparison dashboard showing side-by-side KPI analysis. Add statistical significance testing for A/B results. Implement automatic promotion/rollback based on performance thresholds.

# Test Strategy:
Test traffic splitting accuracy and consistency. Verify statistical calculations for significance testing. Test automatic promotion and rollback triggers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement User Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary database tables and columns to store user information, including credentials and profile data.
### Details:
Define a 'users' table with columns for id (primary key), username (unique), email (unique), hashed_password, created_at, and updated_at. Use a migration script to apply the schema to the development database.

## 2. Develop User Registration API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/auth/register) to handle new user sign-ups.
### Details:
The endpoint should accept username, email, and password. It must validate the input, check for existing username/email, hash the password using a strong algorithm like bcrypt, and store the new user record in the database.

## 3. Develop User Login API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/auth/login) to authenticate users and issue a session token.
### Details:
The endpoint should accept an identifier (email or username) and a password. It will find the user in the database, compare the provided password with the stored hash, and if successful, generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the user ID and an expiration date.

## 4. Build Frontend Registration Form Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Create the user interface for the registration page, including input fields, validation, and submission logic.
### Details:
Develop a UI component with a form for username, email, and password. Implement client-side validation for immediate feedback. On form submission, make an API call to the registration endpoint. Handle success (e.g., redirect to login) and error (e.g., display error messages) responses.

## 5. Build Frontend Login Form Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Create the user interface for the login page to allow users to sign in and manage the authentication token.
### Details:
Develop a UI component with a form for an identifier and password. On submission, call the login API endpoint. Upon receiving a JWT, store it securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie or localStorage) and update the application's global state to reflect the authenticated user. Redirect the user to a protected area.

## 6. Implement Protected Route Guard [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5
### Description: Create a mechanism to restrict access to certain application routes to authenticated users only.
### Details:
Implement a frontend route guard or a higher-order component that checks for the presence and validity of the authentication token before rendering a protected component. If the token is missing or invalid, the user should be redirected to the login page.
