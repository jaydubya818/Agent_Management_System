# Task ID: 10
# Title: Real-time Alerting Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Alerting system for SLO breaches and critical events with webhook integration
# Details:
Implement SLO monitoring with configurable thresholds. Create webhook-based alerting for Slack/PagerDuty integration. Add alert configuration UI for setting up notification rules. Implement alert deduplication and escalation logic.

# Test Strategy:
Test alert triggering with simulated SLO breaches. Verify webhook delivery and retry logic. Test alert configuration UI and rule validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Set Up User Authentication Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary database tables to store user information, including credentials and profile data.
### Details:
The `users` table should include columns for `id` (primary key), `username` (unique), `email` (unique), `password_hash`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. Use a migration script to create and manage the schema.

## 2. Implement User Registration API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/register`) that allows new users to sign up.
### Details:
The endpoint must validate input (e.g., password strength, valid email format), hash the password using a strong algorithm like bcrypt, and store the new user record in the database. Return a success message or user object, excluding the password hash.

## 3. Implement User Login API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/login`) for authenticating existing users and issuing a session token.
### Details:
The endpoint should accept a username/email and a password. It will find the user in the database, compare the provided password with the stored hash, and if they match, generate a secure session token (e.g., JWT) to be returned to the client.

## 4. Create Middleware for Protected Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement server-side middleware to protect certain API endpoints, ensuring they can only be accessed by authenticated users.
### Details:
The middleware should extract the session token from the `Authorization` header of incoming requests. It must then verify the token's validity. If valid, it should attach the user's information to the request object and pass control to the next handler. If invalid, it should return a `401 Unauthorized` error.

## 5. Implement User Logout Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Provide a mechanism for users to log out, invalidating their current session token.
### Details:
Create an endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/logout`) that adds the current session token to a server-side blocklist (e.g., in Redis or a database table). The authentication middleware must be updated to check this blocklist before validating a token.
